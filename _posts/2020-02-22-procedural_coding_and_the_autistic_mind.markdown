Since as far back as I can remember, anyone I spent a significant amount of time with always had a similar qualifier for me: bright, gifted, brilliant. My adventurous curiosity, ceaseless thirst for knowledge, and incessant need to know exactly how everything works led many to label me a "sponge" but I was more like a vacuum.

My elementary school teachers found it an enjoyable novelty to be able to hold an intellectual conversation with a child. They'd bring their college textbooks to class and allow me to work my way through them when they felt the normal classwork simply wasn't stimulating enough. Those who knew me were never surprised when I'd place in the 97th, 98th and 99th percentile time and time again when standardized test results would come in. Unfortunately, these accolades shifted attention from the myriad of symptoms I was dealing with. Despite being capable of flexing my intellect for tests, I was failing horrendously in every other aspect of life.

In school, I either forgot or, more often, chose not to do any of my homework... ever. From kindergarten to High School senior year, I flippantly dismissed homework as something that was unnecessary. My teachers, seeing how well I did on every test knew that I knew the material, so I rarely failed a class, but my GPA hovered in the low 1s. 

Socially, I felt extreme anxiety over what felt like I simply couldn't understand the back-and-forth of interpersonal relationships. I rarely had friends, instead either existing in isolation or gravitating towards groups of ne'er-do-wells. The few romantic relationships I've had left my partners feeling as if the relationship didn't really exist: no emotional connection.

At home, I spent an inordinate amount of time alone. My room was always cluttered and disorganized. My diet was poor and I had an erratic sleep schedule, usually staying up until the early morning. I'd often forget responsibilities, was completely unable to maintain any sense of a routine and was always unprepared.

Nearly every facet of my existence was in disarray until I finally began putting the pieces together in my late twenties and started questioning whether I might be autistic. It took some time and a lot of help from a friend but I was finally diagnosed with high-functioning autism at the age of 30, and since then, my life has dramatically improved.

You're probably wondering, "What does any of this have to do with procedural coding?" 

Well, one interest that has stuck with me since I discovered it at the age of 12 has been coding. I've always been in love with this idea that I can solve problems by laying out exact instructions to achieve an objective goal. There are no subjectives, wishy-washies, interpretations, unspoken rules, gleaning, what-have-yous. It's all concrete logic. 

Now, as an autistic adult, I've spent half of the last decade learning that this is exactly how my mind operates, and by extension, how I have to live my life. I cannot express the profound sense of, "someone gets me," and simultaneously, "I get it!!!," I felt one night while perusing the Asperger's (another term for high-functioning autism) subreddit and read a post consisting of a "Room Cleaning Manual" for people with autism. Essentially, it consisted of steps that left zero room for interpretation, such as:

```
1: Enter the room and walk to the center of the room. If the room isn't perfectly square or rectangular, and has a branching hallway for instance, ignore the hallway for now and stand in the center of the largest area.

2: Face the wall that is opposite the door you entered the room from.

3: Starting with the upper-left corner of the wall you are facing, visually scan from left to right, looking for objects that are out of place. An object is considered out of place if it is not in its predesignated container, such as a pencil on the floor instead of in your desk drawer, clean laundry if it's not in your dresser, dirty laundry if it's not in your laundry basket, trash not in a trash bin, or dishes that need to be taken to the kitchen for washing. If you find an out of place object, collect it and put it in its predesignated container. After you placed the object in its predesignated container, return to the center of the room, face the wall you were previously scanning and continue your visual scan from where you left off. If you find an object that either does not have a predesignated container, or you are unsure of its predesignated container, place the object outside of the room for now and return to your scan.

4: During your scan, when you reach the opposite corner that you started scanning from, move your gaze slightly downward and scan right to left so that you are scanning the area just below the area you previously scanned, remembering to collect out of place objects, put them in their correct places, and returning to your scan. 

5: Continue scanning in this manner, left to right, down, right to left, down, left to right, etc., until you've scanned the entire wall.

6: Now, in the same manner that you scanned the wall, scan the floor in front of you, from the corner in front and to the left of you, scan left to right and right to left looking for out of place objects, moving your gaze downward and toward your feet each time you've completed a section. This section of the floor has been successfully scanned when you've completed the section that is directly in front of your feet.

7: Turn left until you are directly facing the next adjoining wall and repeat the visual scanning process for both the wall and the floor. 
```

etc., etc.

As you can see, this is extremely similar to how you would program an application to accomplish a task. This was an eye opening moment for me, as it gave me the reason why I feel so much more comfortable with computers and code than I do with anything else, and it showed me how to frame solutions to real-world problems so I can tackle them with ease. 

I won't go so far as to say that a single Reddit post changed my entire life. There is so much more work over the past 5 years that I've put into understanding what it means to be autistic, but this random post I stumbled upon one night definitely changed how I think about... how I think. Relationships, career goals, taking care of myself, preparing for the future, I look at all of it, all of life, through the eyes of a coder; every task can be broken down into logical steps that can then be followed in order to achieve the goal. 

Producedural code is the best metaphor for my life that I could ever imagine.
